## Hat of Object Permanence
*Wondrous item, common*

Whoever puts on this hat immediately forgets that they are wearing a hat.

After being surprised by this twice, one can make a DC17 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, or a DC18 Wisdom (Insight) check to try and figure
out what is happening.

Succeeding the check makes you realise what is going on, but it does *not*
protect you from being surprised by it again, because you simply forget.
