Woah~! âœ¨

## Cheese for the Cheese God
Also starting at 1st level, all Lightning and Thunder damage that your weapons
or spells deal becomes Cheese damage instead. It mostly affects targets the
same way the original damage type would, with one exception: Lactose intolerant
targets take double damage.  
This bonus stacks with the usual multiplier in case the target is weak against the
original damage type.

Visual effects of spells that deal those damage types also turn yellow and the
spells leave a smell of cheese in their affected area for one minute.

## Channel Divinity: Spread the Cheese
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bless everyone with
the wonders of cheese.

As an action, you call forth a Divine Aura of Cheese that fills either the
current room, or a 30-foot sphere around you. The aura appears as a light yellow
shimmer and everything within it seems to sparkle. The aura is present for up
to 10 minutes, but you can dispel it as a bonus action if you so choose.

All food that is present at the time of invocation will be purified and either
turned into cheese entirely, or refined by adding magical cheese.
Food that is already cheese or already contains cheese doubles in amount.

The consumables that are transformed by this effect gain magical properties:

- Any healing effect the food previously had is doubled. It there was none,
  consuming it now restores hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.
- Hostile creatures that consume them become friendly for as long as the aura
  is present and regard you as a comrade. Depending on whether they like
  cheese, this effect may become permanent.
- Friendly creatures that consume them regard them as the best food they ever
  had and are fully aware that this gift was given to them by you and your
  church.
