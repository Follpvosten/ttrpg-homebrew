# Bonus proficiency
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with the Cheese
Hammer, a variant of the War Hammer that deals Cheese (Lightning) damage.

With signing the papers to join the church, you also get a free Cheese Hammer!
Woah~! âœ¨

# Cheese for the Cheese God
Also starting at 1st level, all Lightning and Thunder damage that your weapons
or spells deal becomes Cheese damage instead. It mostly affects targets the
same way the original damage type would, with one exception: Lactose intolerant
targets take double damage.  
This bonus stacks with the usual multiplier in case the target is weak against the
original damage type.

Visual effects of spells that deal those damage types also turn yellow and the
spells leave a smell of cheese in their affected area for one minute.
